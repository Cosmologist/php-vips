# High-level PHP binding for libvips 

`php-vips` is a binding for [libvips](https://github.com/jcupitt/libvips) for
PHP 7. 

libvips is fast and needs little memory. The [`vips-php-bench`](
https://github.com/jcupitt/php-vips-bench) repository tests
`php-vips` against `imagick` and `gd`. On that test, and on my laptop,
`php-vips` is around four times faster than `imagick` and needs 10 times less
memory. 

Programs that use libvips don't manipulate images directly, instead they
create pipelines of image processing operations starting from a source
image. When the pipe is connected to a destination, the whole pipeline
executes at once and in parallel, streaming the image from source to
destination in a set of small fragments.

This module builds upon the `vips` PHP extension, see:

https://github.com/jcupitt/php-vips-ext

You'll need to install that first. It's tested on Linux and macOS --- 
Windows would need some work, but should be possible.  

### Example

```php
#!/usr/bin/env php
<?php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
use Jcupitt\Vips;

$image = Vips\Image::newFromFile($argv[1]);

echo "width = ", $image->width, "\n";

$image = $image->invert();

$image->writeToFile($argv[2]);
?>
```

You'll need this in your `composer.json`:

```
    "require": {
            "jcupitt/vips" : "1.0.0"
    }
```

And run with:

```
$ composer install
$ ./try1.php ~/pics/k2.jpg x.tif
```

We have a [full set of formatted API docs 
here](docs/classes/Jcupitt.Vips.Image.html).

### Introduction to the API

Almost all methods return a new image for the result, so you can chain them.
For example:

```php
$image = $image->more(12)->ifthenelse(255, $image);
```

will make a mask of pixels greater than 12, then use the mask to set pixels to
either 255 or the original image.

You use long, double, array and image as parameters. For example:

```php
$image = $image->add(2);
```

to add two to every band element, or:

```php
$image = $image->add([1, 2, 3]);
```

to add 1 to the first band, 2 to the second and 3 to the third. Or:

```php
$image = $image->add($image2);
```

to add two images. Or: 

```php
$image = $image->add([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]);
```

To make a 2 x 3 image from the array, then add that image to the original.

Almost all methods can take an extra final argument: an array of options.
For example:

```php
$image->writeToFile("fred.jpg", ["Q" => 90]);
```

`php-vips` comes with full API docs, run:

```
$ vendor/bin/phpdoc
```

And look in `docs/`. You can [browse these docs online 
too](docs/classes/Jcupitt.Vips.Image.html).

There are around 300 operations in the library, see the vips docs for an
introduction:

### How it works

The `vips` extension defines a simple but ugly way to call any libvips
operation from PHP.  It uses libvips' own introspection facilities
and does not depend on anything else (so no gobject-introspection,
for example). It's a fairly short 1,600 lines of C.

This module is a PHP layer over the ugly `vips` extension that
tries to make a nice interface for programmers. It uses `__call()` and
`__get()` to make all libvips operations appear as methods, and all
libvips properties as properties of the PHP `Vips\Image` class.

### Test and install

```
$ phpcs --standard=PSR2 src
$ php ~/packages/php/composer.phar install
$ vendor/bin/phpunit
$ vendor/bin/phpdoc
```

### Regenerate auto docs

```
$ cd src
$ ../examples/generate_phpdoc.rb
```
